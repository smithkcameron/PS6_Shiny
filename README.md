This app used the satellite data (UAH lower troposphere) for global temperatures, in celcius, from 1978-2023.

The first "About" tab is a brief overview of the app and what it does, and also includes a map of current global temperatures.

The "Plot" tab allows one to filter a data plot for different regions (global, land, ocean, and US).

Finally, the "Table" tab allows one to filter & explore the data set by searching specifics or choosing a date range.

I hope you enjoy using the app!
